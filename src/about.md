2019-2021

Your Future Worlds is a project created to celebrate the young voices of Hackney and their aspirations for the future. Run by Eastside Educational Trust, Syrup have been commissioned to work with the community to produce an interactive artwork.

Originally conceived as part of the Changing Worlds Festival of youth creativity that was due to take place in May 2020, the project has been through several iterations as we adapted to the changing context caused by the pandemic.

Fast forward to 2021, and weâ€™ve landed in the digital realm. Listen to the thoughts of the young people we spoke to who live in the borough and add your thoughts to our digital noticeboard. How do you see Hackney in 50 years time? What would you like to see change?

With huge thanks to Hackney Young Carers; Peer Gallery Young Ambassadors; Bridge Academy, City of London Academy and Shoreditch Park schools; and the local businesses on Hoxton street and members of the public we spoke to as part of this project.

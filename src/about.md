Your Future Worlds is a project created to celebrate the young voices of Hackney and their aspirations for the future. Run by Eastside, and supported by Hackney Council, Syrup have been commissioned to work with the community to produce an interactive artwork.

Originally conceived as part of the Changing Worlds Festival (a celebration of youth creativity) that was due to take place in May 2020, the project has adapted to the changing context caused by the pandemic.

Fast forward to 2021, and we’ve landed in the digital realm. Listen to the thoughts of the young residents  we spoke to and add your thoughts to our digital noticeboard. What will the world be like in 50 years time? What will the future of Hackney look like?


With sincere thanks to Hackney Council, Hackney Young Carers; Peer Gallery Ambassadors; Bridge Academy Hackney, City of London Academy Shoreditch Park, Hoxton Garden, St Monica’s, Shoreditch Park and Thomas Fairchild Primaries; and the local businesses on Hoxton street and members of the public we spoke to as part of this project.
